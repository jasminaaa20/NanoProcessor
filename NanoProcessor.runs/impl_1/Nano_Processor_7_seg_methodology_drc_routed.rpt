2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell NanoProcessor/Program_Counter_0/D_FF_1/Q_i_1__2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) NanoProcessor/Reg_Bank_0/Reg_4_2/Reg_0/Q_reg/CLR, NanoProcessor/Reg_Bank_0/Reg_4_2/Reg_1/Q_reg/CLR, NanoProcessor/Reg_Bank_0/Reg_4_2/Reg_2/Q_reg/CLR, NanoProcessor/Reg_Bank_0/Reg_4_2/Reg_3/Q_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell NanoProcessor/Program_Counter_0/D_FF_1/Q_i_1__3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) NanoProcessor/Reg_Bank_0/Reg_4_7/Reg_0/Q_reg/CLR, NanoProcessor/Reg_Bank_0/Reg_4_7/Reg_1/Q_reg/CLR, NanoProcessor/Reg_Bank_0/Reg_4_7/Reg_2/Q_reg/CLR, NanoProcessor/Reg_Bank_0/Reg_4_7/Reg_3/Q_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell NanoProcessor/Program_Counter_0/D_FF_1/Q_i_2__1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) NanoProcessor/Reg_Bank_0/Reg_4_1/Reg_0/Q_reg/CLR, NanoProcessor/Reg_Bank_0/Reg_4_1/Reg_1/Q_reg/CLR, NanoProcessor/Reg_Bank_0/Reg_4_1/Reg_2/Q_reg/CLR, NanoProcessor/Reg_Bank_0/Reg_4_1/Reg_3/Q_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
